Eye-gaze tracking is the process of measuring the position of the user’s eye gaze. It is widely being employed in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research area as an alternative to traditional input devices such as mouse and keyboard. For people who have a disability in communication, giving some information to other people is a hard thing to do. New portable and non-invasive eye-tracking algorithms allow the creation of robust eye-gaze controlled virtual keyboards that aim to improve the life of disabled people who are unable to communicate. The goal of the application is to write without using hands. Such applications are really important for people affected by quadriplegia, who completely lost the control of their limbs or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also referred to as motor neuron disease in some countries, it involves the death of neurons in a patient’s brain. It results in muscle twitching and a gradual deterioration of muscles that lead to difficulty swallowing, speaking and eventually breathing. A completely Eye – Gaze controlled virtual keyboard with minimal use of external switches will aid the communication of the diseased people.
